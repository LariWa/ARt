# ARt - AR Pictionary

ARt is an interactive Pictionary game. One player can draw in 3D using Microsoft Hololens. Different brushes and pencils as well as different colors can be used, to create the ultimate 3D drawing. Other players can explore the drawing using their phones or tablets. Through AR they can walk around the drawing and see it from different viewpoints. The drawer can also use gestures or interact with his drawing to make it easier to guess the corresponding word for the other players. The goal of the game is to draw and guess as many words as possible in 2 minutes and get the highest score. Random prompts are used for fair gameplay.
